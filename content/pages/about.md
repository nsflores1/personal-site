I'm a third-year college student pursuing a BA in Geosciences at Williams College. In general, my main interests lie in the combination of geosciences and computer science, with specific focus on remote sensing and high performance computing. My background spans all levels of the geospatial development stack, from creating end-user data visualizations to creating reproducible builds and effective CI/CD pipelines. Always looking for the next challenging problem to solve.
